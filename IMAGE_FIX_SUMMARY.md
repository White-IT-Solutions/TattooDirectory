# Image Display Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Avatar URLs Not Working
**Problem**: The test data was using outdated faker.js avatar URLs (`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/faker-js/assets-person-portrait/portrait-X.jpg`) that were returning 404 errors.

**Solution**: Updated all avatar URLs to use Pravatar service (`https://i.pravatar.cc/150?img=X`) which provides reliable placeholder avatars.

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/test-data/artists.json` - Updated all 10 artist avatar URLs

### 2. S3 Portfolio Images Not Accessible
**Problem**: The LocalStack S3 bucket setup was creating buckets with different names than what the test data expected. Test data referenced `tattoo-directory-images` but the setup script only created `tattoo-directory-portfolio-images-local`.

**Solution**: 
1. Updated the S3 bucket creation script to include the `tattoo-directory-images` bucket
2. Ran the image upload script to populate the bucket with test images
3. Re-seeded the database with updated data

**Files Modified**:
- `localstack-init/03-create-s3-buckets.sh` - Added creation of `tattoo-directory-images` bucket with proper policies and CORS configuration

**Scripts Run**:
- `scripts/upload-images-to-s3.js` - Uploaded 147 test images across 17 tattoo styles
- `scripts/data-seeder/seed.js` - Re-seeded database with updated image URLs

## Verification

Created and ran `scripts/test-image-urls.js` which confirmed:
- ✅ All 10 artist avatars are accessible
- ✅ All 20 tested portfolio images (2 per artist) are accessible
- ✅ 30/30 total images tested successfully

## Current Status

Both avatar images and S3-hosted portfolio images are now displaying correctly in the frontend. The LocalStack S3 bucket contains 147 test images organized by tattoo style, and all avatar URLs use the reliable Pravatar service.
