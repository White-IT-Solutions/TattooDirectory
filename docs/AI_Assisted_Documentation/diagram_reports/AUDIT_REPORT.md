# Architecture Diagrams Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This audit report analyzes all 16 existing mermaid diagrams in `docs/diagrams_as_code/` against the current Terraform infrastructure implementation (19 modules) and system design documentation. The analysis reveals significant gaps in multi-account architecture representation, missing infrastructure components, and incomplete service relationships.

## Key Findings

### Critical Gaps Identified

1. **Missing Multi-Account Architecture**: No diagrams show the AWS Control Tower four-account structure (Management, Infrastructure, Audit, Log Archive)
2. **Incomplete Logging Pipeline**: Missing Kinesis Firehose for WAF logs and cross-account log flows
3. **Simplified VPC Architecture**: Missing complete VPC endpoints and security group relationships
4. **No Backup/DR Representation**: Missing AWS Backup service and cross-region replication
5. **Outdated Service Relationships**: Some service connections are simplified or missing

3. Create comprehensive changes documentation

## Validation Checklist

For each updated diagram, verify:
- [ ] All components exist in Terraform modules
- [ ] Account boundaries are accurately represented
- [ ] Service relationships match actual connections
- [ ] Security group relationships are correct
- [ ] Cross-account data flows are accurate
- [ ] Mermaid syntax renders correctly

## Conclusion

The current diagram set requires significant updates to accurately represent the implemented infrastructure. The most critical gap is the lack of multi-account architecture representation, followed by missing logging pipeline components and incomplete service inventories. A systematic update following the priority recommendations will bring the diagrams in line with the actual infrastructure implementation.
