# Architecture Diagrams Changes Documentation

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive record of all changes made to the architecture diagrams during the update project. The changes were driven by the need to accurately represent the current AWS Control Tower multi-account infrastructure implementation with 19 Terraform modules, as documented in the audit report.

## Summary of Changes

### New Diagrams Created: 3
### Existing Diagrams Updated: 8
### Diagrams Reviewed (Minor/No Changes): 5
### Total Diagrams: 16

## New Diagrams Created

### 1. Multi-Account Architecture.md âœ¨ NEW
**Purpose**: Establish the foundational AWS Control Tower four-account structure representation

**Components Added**:
- Management Account (root) with IAM Identity Center, AWS Organizations, Control Tower
- Infrastructure OU containing App-Dev Account with all application resources
- Security OU containing Audit Account and Log Archive Account
- Cross-account IAM roles and permission sets
- Control Tower guardrails and organizational boundaries

**Requirements Addressed**: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3
**Rationale**: No existing diagram showed the complete multi-account structure that forms the foundation of the entire infrastructure. This diagram establishes the account boundaries that all other diagrams reference.

### 2. Logging Architecture.md âœ¨ NEW
**Purpose**: Comprehensive logging pipeline across all accounts

**Components Added**:
- Infrastructure Account: CloudWatch Logs, application logs, VPC Flow Logs
- Audit Account: Kinesis Firehose streaming WAF logs
- Log Archive Account: S3 buckets (CloudTrail, Config, VPC Flow Logs, WAF, Access Logs)
- Cross-account log delivery mechanisms and IAM roles
- S3 lifecycle policies and cross-region replication for production
- Immutable audit trail storage

**Requirements Addressed**: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3
**Rationale**: The audit revealed that logging architecture was scattered across multiple diagrams without a comprehensive view. This diagram consolidates all logging flows and shows the complete pipeline from log generation to long-term storage.

### 3. Backup and Disaster Recovery.md âœ¨ NEW
**Purpose**: Complete backup strategies and disaster recovery architecture

**Components Added**:
- AWS Backup service architecture with vaults in Log Archive Account
- Backup plans, selections, and retention policies
- Cross-region backup replication for production environments
- DynamoDB table backups and ECS configuration backups
- S3 cross-region replication for log storage buckets
- RTO/RPO targets and recovery procedures

**Requirements Addressed**: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4
**Rationale**: No existing diagram covered backup and disaster recovery, which is a critical operational aspect implemented through Terraform module 16-backup.

## Design Decision Rationale

### Multi-Account Structure Choice
**Decision**: Implement AWS Control Tower four-account structure
**Rationale**: Based on Terraform modules 01-management-account, 03-audit-foundation, and 08-log-storage, the infrastructure follows AWS best practices for account separation
**Impact**: All diagrams now clearly show account boundaries and cross-account relationships

### Logging Architecture Centralization
**Decision**: Create dedicated logging architecture diagram
**Rationale**: Terraform module 04-central-logging implements Kinesis Firehose for WAF logs, requiring clear representation of cross-account log flows
**Impact**: Logging flows are now clearly documented and traceable across accounts

### VPC Endpoints Completeness
**Decision**: Show all Gateway and Interface endpoints
**Rationale**: Terraform module 05-networking deploys comprehensive VPC endpoints that significantly impact cost and security
**Impact**: Network architecture now accurately represents private connectivity and traffic routing

### Backup Service Integration
**Decision**: Create dedicated backup and disaster recovery diagram
**Rationale**: Terraform module 16-backup implements comprehensive backup strategy that wasn't represented in any existing diagram
**Impact**: Operational procedures and disaster recovery capabilities are now clearly documented
