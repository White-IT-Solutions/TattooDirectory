## Infrastructure Alignment Verification

### Terraform Module Coverage ✅
All 19 Terraform modules are represented across the diagrams:
- ✅ 01-foundation through 19-delivery
- ✅ Multi-account structure matches module organization
- ✅ Service relationships align with module dependencies

### AWS Service Representation ✅
Key services validated across diagrams:
- ✅ **Compute**: Lambda, Fargate, ECS, Step Functions
- ✅ **Storage**: S3, DynamoDB, OpenSearch
- ✅ **Networking**: VPC, VPC Endpoints, NAT Gateway, CloudFront
- ✅ **Security**: WAF, GuardDuty, Config, Security Hub, IAM
- ✅ **Monitoring**: CloudWatch, X-Ray (where applicable)
- ✅ **Governance**: Control Tower, Organizations, IAM Identity Center

### Cross-Account Data Flows ✅
Validated against actual implementation:
- ✅ WAF logs: Infrastructure → Audit → Log Archive (via Firehose)
- ✅ VPC Flow logs: Infrastructure → Log Archive (direct)
- ✅ CloudTrail: All accounts → Log Archive (Control Tower managed)
- ✅ Backup data: Infrastructure → Log Archive (AWS Backup)

## Security and Network Validation

### VPC Endpoint Configuration ✅
- ✅ **Gateway Endpoints**: S3, DynamoDB with route table integration
- ✅ **Interface Endpoints**: SQS, ECR, Secrets Manager, CloudWatch Logs, Step Functions, OpenSearch
- ✅ **Security Groups**: Proper ingress/egress rules for all endpoints
- ✅ **Traffic Routing**: Private connectivity without internet routing

### Security Group Relationships ✅
