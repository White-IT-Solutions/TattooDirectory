# Module 01-Foundation Refactoring Summary

## Completed Tasks âœ…

### 1. Created Security Foundation Module
- **Location**: `modules/security-foundation/`
- **Purpose**: Manages KMS key for logs encryption in the Security Account
- **Resources Moved**:
  - `aws_kms_key.logs` - KMS key for CloudWatch logs encryption
  - `aws_kms_alias.logs` - Alias for the logs KMS key

### 2. Updated 01-Foundation Module
- **Removed Resources**:
  - `aws_kms_key.logs` and `aws_kms_alias.logs` (moved to security-foundation)
  - Related outputs for logs KMS key
- **Retained Resources**:
  - `aws_kms_key.main` - Main KMS key for application data
  - `aws_kms_key.replica` - Replica KMS key for cross-region replication
  - `random_id.suffix` - Random suffix for resource naming
  - `random_password.*` - Random passwords for OpenSearch and app secrets
  - `aws_signer_signing_profile.lambda` - Lambda code signing profile
  - `aws_lambda_code_signing_config.main` - Lambda code signing configuration

### 3. Updated Environment Configuration
- **Dev Environment** (`environments/dev/`):
  - Added `security_foundation` module to `main.tf`
  - Updated all module references to use `module.security_foundation.kms_key_logs_arn`
  - Added `infra_account_id` and `security_account_id` variables
  - Updated `dev.tfvars` with placeholder account IDs
- **Prod Environment** (`environments/prod/`):
  - Created `variables.tf` with all necessary variables
  - Updated `prod.tfvars` with placeholder account IDs

### 4. Cross-Account KMS Key Policy
- **Security Foundation KMS Key** includes:
  - Security Account root permissions
  - CloudWatch Logs service permissions for Security Account
  - Cross-account permissions for Infrastructure Account to use the key

## Next Steps ðŸ“‹

### 1. Update Account IDs
Replace placeholder account IDs in both environments:
```hcl
# In dev.tfvars and prod.tfvars
infra_account_id    = "YOUR_ACTUAL_INFRA_ACCOUNT_ID"
security_account_id = "YOUR_ACTUAL_SECURITY_ACCOUNT_ID"
```

### 2. Configure AWS Providers for Multi-Account
The security-foundation module should be deployed to the Security Account. Update the provider configuration:

```hcl
# In environments/dev/main.tf
module "security_foundation" {
  source  = "../../modules/security-foundation"
  context = local.context

  providers = {
    aws = aws.security  # Deploy to Security Account
  }
}
```

### 3. Test the Refactoring
1. Run `terraform plan` in the dev environment
2. Verify that the logs KMS key will be created in the Security Account
3. Verify that other modules can reference the cross-account KMS key ARN

### 4. State Migration (If Existing Infrastructure)
If you have existing infrastructure, you'll need to:
1. Import the existing logs KMS key into the security-foundation module state
2. Remove it from the foundation module state
3. Update any existing log groups to use the new KMS key ARN

## Key Benefits Achieved ðŸŽ¯

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Application encryption keys stay in Infrastructure Account, logging encryption keys in Security Account
2. **Centralized Logging Security**: All log encryption is managed from the Security Account
3. **Cross-Account Access**: Proper IAM policies allow Infrastructure Account to use Security Account KMS key
4. **Scalable Pattern**: This pattern can be applied to other modules (networking, storage, etc.)

## Module Dependencies After Refactoring

```
foundation (Infra Account)
â”œâ”€â”€ Provides: main KMS key, random values, code signing
â””â”€â”€ Used by: storage, compute, iam, etc.

security-foundation (Security Account)  
â”œâ”€â”€ Provides: logs KMS key
â””â”€â”€ Used by: networking, api, monitoring, etc.
```
