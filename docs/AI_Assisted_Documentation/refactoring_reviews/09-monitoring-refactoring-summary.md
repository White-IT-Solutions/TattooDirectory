# Module 09-Monitoring Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The 09-monitoring module has been successfully refactored to support the multi-account architecture by splitting monitoring responsibilities between operational and security concerns.

## Refactoring Changes

### 1. Module Split
**Original**: Single `09-monitoring` module
**New**: Two specialized modules:
- `app-monitoring` (Infrastructure Account) - Application performance monitoring
- `security-monitoring` (Security Account) - Security events and compliance monitoring

### 2. App Monitoring Module (Infrastructure Account)
**Location**: `modules/app-monitoring/`
**Purpose**: Monitor application performance and operational metrics

**Resources**:
- CloudWatch alarms for API Gateway (4XX, 5XX errors, latency)
- CloudWatch alarms for Lambda functions (errors, duration)
- CloudWatch alarms for DynamoDB (throttles, system errors)
- CloudWatch alarms for OpenSearch (cluster status, CPU)
- CloudWatch dashboard for application overview
- SNS topics for operational alerts (`critical_alerts`, `warning_alerts`)
- CloudWatch Log Insights queries for application troubleshooting

### 3. Security Monitoring Module (Security Account)
**Location**: `modules/security-monitoring/`
**Purpose**: Monitor security events and compliance across the organization

**Resources**:
- SNS topic for security alerts
- CloudWatch alarms for GuardDuty findings
- CloudWatch alarms for AWS Config compliance
- CloudWatch alarms for CloudTrail errors
- CloudWatch Log Insights queries for security analysis

### 4. Key Architecture Changes

#### Before Refactoring
```
09-monitoring (Single Module)
├── Application alarms (Lambda, API, DynamoDB)
├── Security alarms (GuardDuty, Config)
├── Mixed SNS topics (operational + security)
├── Application dashboard
└── All log groups (centralized)
```

#### After Refactoring
```
app-monitoring (Infrastructure Account)
├── Application performance alarms
├── Application dashboard
├── Operational SNS topics
└── Application log insights queries

security-monitoring (Security Account)
├── Security event alarms
├── Compliance monitoring alarms
├── Security alerts SNS topic
└── Security log insights queries
```

### 5. Log Group Management Changes
- **Removed**: Centralized log group creation from monitoring module
- **New Approach**: Each service module creates its own log groups
- **Benefit**: Makes modules more self-contained and follows best practices

### 6. Cross-Account Integration
- **Operational Issues**: Infrastructure Account → `app_monitoring` SNS topics
- **Security Issues**: Security Account → `security_monitoring` SNS topic
- **KMS Encryption**: Appropriate keys for each account

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Clear Separation**: Operational vs. security monitoring responsibilities
2. **Centralized Security Alerting**: All security events routed to Security Account
3. **Application Focus**: Developers get operational alerts in Infrastructure Account
4. **Compliance Ready**: Security team controls all security monitoring
5. **Self-Contained Modules**: Log groups managed by service modules
6. **Scalable Pattern**: Can be extended to other monitoring needs

## Files Created

### New Modules
- `modules/app-monitoring/main.tf`
- `modules/app-monitoring/variables.tf`
- `modules/app-monitoring/outputs.tf`
- `modules/app-monitoring/versions.tf`
- `modules/app-monitoring/dashboard.json.tftpl`
- `modules/security-monitoring/main.tf`
- `modules/security-monitoring/variables.tf`
- `modules/security-monitoring/outputs.tf`
- `modules/security-monitoring/versions.tf`

### Modified Files
- `environments/dev/main.tf` - Updated to use split modules

## Breaking Changes

### Module Output Changes
- `module.monitoring.*` outputs no longer exist
- Use `module.app_monitoring.*` for application monitoring resources
- Use `module.security_monitoring.*` for security monitoring resources

### Log Group Management
- Log groups are no longer created by monitoring module
- Each service module must create its own log groups
- Update any references to centralized log groups

## Next Steps

1. **Configure Multi-Account Deployment**: Update provider configuration for security account
2. **Update Log Group References**: Ensure all service modules create their own log groups
3. **Configure Security Log Groups**: Add CloudTrail and Config log groups to security monitoring
4. **Test Cross-Account Monitoring**: Verify alarm triggering and SNS notifications

## Status
✅ **Complete** - Ready for deployment and testing
