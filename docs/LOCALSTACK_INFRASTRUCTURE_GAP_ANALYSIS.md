# LocalStack Infrastructure Gap Analysis

## Executive Summary

This document analyzes the current LocalStack Community (free) test environment against the complete AWS infrastructure defined in the system design documents (HLD, LLD, PSD, PRD). The analysis is structured around the project's two-phase implementation approach and identifies key AWS services missing from the LocalStack deployment that would enhance the local development environment's fidelity to the production architecture.

**Key Constraint**: This analysis is limited to LocalStack Community Edition (free) services only, excluding LocalStack Pro features.

## Implementation Phase Context

### Phase 1: Core API & Data Platform (Current Focus)
**Scope**: User, Edge, API Compute, and Data/Search layers populated with seed dataset
**Goal**: Prove core application functionality with manual data seeding

### Phase 2: Async Data Aggregation Engine (Future)
**Scope**: Event-driven backend workflow for automated data collection
**Goal**: Enable live data collection and processing pipeline

## Current LocalStack Service Coverage

### ✅ Phase 1 Services (Currently Implemented)

The existing LocalStack configuration covers the essential Phase 1 services:

- **DynamoDB**: Main table with GSIs for artist data ✅
- **OpenSearch**: Search functionality for artist discovery ✅
- **S3**: Buckets for portfolio images and static assets ✅
- **API Gateway**: REST API endpoints ✅
- **Lambda**: Basic function deployment capability ✅
- **IAM**: Basic role and policy management ✅
- **Secrets Manager**: Secret storage and retrieval ✅

## Conclusion

The current LocalStack environment adequately covers the **Phase 1 Core Platform** requirements (User, Edge, API Compute, and Data/Search layers) but lacks some supporting services that would enhance the development experience.

### Immediate Recommendations (Phase 1)

1. **Enable DynamoDB Streams** - Critical for testing the data synchronization feature (F3)
2. **Add CloudWatch Logs** - Essential for debugging Lambda functions and API Gateway
3. **Add SNS Topics** - Support the data governance/takedown process (F6)

### Future Recommendations (Phase 2)

When Phase 2 development begins (Async Data Aggregation Engine), add:
1. **SQS with DLQ** - Essential for scraping job queue management
2. **EventBridge** - Required for scheduled pipeline triggers
3. **CloudWatch Metrics** - Monitoring and alerting for the data pipeline

### LocalStack Community Edition Strategy

The recommended approach leverages LocalStack Community Edition effectively by:
- **Phase 1**: Focus on immediately available services that enhance current development
- **Phase 2**: Use Community Edition services with architectural adaptations for Pro-only features
- **Workarounds**: Implement Lambda-based alternatives for Step Functions and ECS/Fargate

This phased approach ensures cost-effective local development while maintaining reasonable fidelity to the production architecture within the constraints of LocalStack Community Edition.
