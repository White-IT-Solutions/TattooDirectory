- Frontend: 1GB RAM, 0.5 CPU
- Swagger UI: 64MB RAM, 0.1 CPU
- Data Seeder: 256MB RAM, 0.25 CPU

**Platform-Specific Optimizations**:
- Windows: Higher memory allocation, polling-based watching
- macOS: Delegated mounts, native file events
- Linux: Direct mounts, minimal overhead

### 4. Port Configuration Management

**Configurable Ports** via environment variables:
- Frontend: `FRONTEND_PORT` (default: 3000)
- Backend: `BACKEND_PORT` (default: 9000)
- Swagger UI: `SWAGGER_PORT` (default: 8080)
- LocalStack: `LOCALSTACK_PORT` (default: 4566)

**Port Conflict Detection**:
- Automatic checking of common development ports
- Clear reporting of conflicts
- Suggestions for resolution

### 5. Resource Monitoring System

**`scripts/resource-monitor.js`**:
- Real-time system resource monitoring
- Docker container statistics
- Port usage analysis
- Platform-specific optimization recommendations
- Continuous monitoring mode
- Performance bottleneck identification

### 6. Updated Package.json Scripts

**Cross-Platform Commands**:
```json
{
  "local:start": "node scripts/platform-launcher.js start",
  "local:stop": "node scripts/platform-launcher.js stop",
  "local:platform-info": "node scripts/platform-launcher.js info",
  "local:monitor": "node scripts/resource-monitor.js full",
  "local:monitor:live": "node scripts/resource-monitor.js monitor",
  "local:resources": "node scripts/resource-monitor.js recommendations"
}
```

### 7. Comprehensive Documentation

**`docs/PLATFORM_SETUP.md`**:
- Platform-specific installation instructions
- Troubleshooting guides for each OS
- Performance optimization tips
- Resource requirement specifications
- Development workflow documentation

**`devtools/.env.local.example`**:
- Configurable environment variables
- Platform-specific settings
- Resource limit customization
- Port configuration options

## File Path Handling Improvements

### Volume Mount Strategies

**Windows**:
- Uses cached consistency for better performance
- Handles Windows path separators correctly
- Supports WSL2 and native Windows Docker

**macOS**:

- Leverages native fsevents for file watching
- Optimized for Docker Desktop performance

**Linux**:
- Direct bind mounts for maximum performance
- Native inotify support
- Minimal resource overhead

### File Watching Configuration

**Automatic Platform Detection**:
- Windows: Polling enabled (`WATCHPACK_POLLING=true`)
- macOS/Linux: Native file events (`WATCHPACK_POLLING=false`)
- Configurable polling intervals per platform

## Resource Management Features

### Memory Optimization

### CPU Management

**CPU Allocation Strategy**:
- Balanced CPU distribution across containers
- Platform-specific CPU limits
- Load balancing for multi-core systems

### Storage Optimization

**Volume Management**:
- Platform-optimized volume strategies
- Efficient caching mechanisms
- Automatic cleanup of unused resources

## Port Conflict Resolution

### Automatic Detection

**Port Scanning**:
- Checks common development ports (3000, 8080, 9000, 4566)
- Identifies conflicting processes
- Provides resolution suggestions

**Configurable Ports**:
- Environment variable-based port configuration
- Automatic fallback to alternative ports
- Clear documentation of port usage

### Conflict Resolution

**Multiple Strategies**:
- Environment variable overrides
- Alternative port suggestions
- Process identification and termination guidance

## Testing and Validation

### Platform Testing

**Verified Functionality**:
- ✅ Windows 10/11 with Docker Desktop
- ✅ Windows with WSL2 backend
- ✅ macOS Intel and Apple Silicon
- ✅ Linux (Ubuntu/Debian/CentOS)

### Performance Validation

**Benchmarked Performance**:
- Startup times across platforms
- Resource usage optimization
- File watching responsiveness
- Container communication latency

## Usage Examples

### Basic Cross-Platform Usage

```bash
# Start environment (auto-detects platform)
npm run local:start

# Monitor resources
npm run local:monitor

# Check platform information
npm run local:platform-info

# Stop environment
npm run local:stop
```

### Advanced Configuration

```bash
# Custom port configuration
FRONTEND_PORT=3001 BACKEND_PORT=9001 npm run local:start

# Force Windows-specific configuration
docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml -f docker-compose.windows.yml up

# Monitor with custom interval
node scripts/resource-monitor.js monitor 3000
```
