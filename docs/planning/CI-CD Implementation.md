# CI/CD Implementation Guide

Container Image Compatibility and CI/CD Pipeline Implementation for the Tattoo Directory MVP.

## Container Image Compatibility

This is the primary technical requirement. A Docker image built for an x86 processor will not run on a Graviton (ARM64) processor.

### Multi-Architecture Builds
The best practice is to build a multi-architecture container image. This single image manifest contains layers for both linux/amd64 (x86) and linux/arm64. When you deploy, the container runtime (Fargate, in this case) automatically pulls the correct version for its underlying architecture. This gives you maximum flexibility.

### Base Image Requirements
You must ensure your Dockerfile starts from a base image that supports ARM64. Most official images (like node, python, amazonlinux) provide multi-architecture variants.

### Dependencies
Your application code itself (Node.js) is architecture-agnostic. However, if any of your npm packages include native C++ add-ons (e.g., some image processing or cryptography libraries), you must ensure they provide pre-compiled binaries for ARM64 or can be compiled for ARM64 during your build process. Your current dependencies (@opensearch-project/opensearch, @aws-sdk/*) are pure JavaScript and fully compatible.

## CI/CD Pipeline Adjustments

### Use docker buildx
This is the recommended approach for building multi-architecture images.

```bash
# Enable buildx
docker buildx create --use

# Build multi-architecture image
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t your-image:tag --push .
```

### Pipeline Configuration
```yaml
name: Build and Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3
      
      - name: Build and push multi-arch image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
        with:
          platforms: linux/amd64,linux/arm64
          push: true
          tags: your-registry/your-image:latest
```
