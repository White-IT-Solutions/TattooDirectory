# Studio CLI Commands Documentation

## Overview

The Data CLI has been extended with comprehensive studio-specific commands that allow developers to manage studio data independently from artist data. These commands support studio-only operations, validation, relationship management, and image processing.

## Available Studio Commands

### 1. `seed-studios` - Studio Data Seeding

Seed only studio data without affecting existing artist data.

**Usage:**
```bash
npm run seed-studios [options]
node scripts/data-cli.js seed-studios [options]
```

**Options:**
- `--scenario <name>` - Use specific scenario for studio generation
- `--count <number>` - Override studio count for generation
- `--force` - Force regeneration of existing studio data
- `--validate` - Validate studio data after seeding

**Examples:**
```bash
# Basic studio seeding
npm run seed-studios

# Seed with specific scenario
npm run seed-studios --scenario studio-diverse

# Seed with custom count and validation
npm run seed-studios --count 5 --validate

# Force regeneration with scenario
npm run seed-studios --force --scenario london-studios
```

**Requirements Addressed:** 6.1, 6.4, 6.5

### 2. `validate-studios` - Studio Data Validation

Validate only studio-related data and relationships.

**Usage:**
```bash
npm run validate-studios [type]
node scripts/data-cli.js validate-studios [type]
```

**Validation Types:**
- `all` - Comprehensive studio validation (default)
- `data` - Studio data structure and required fields
- `relationships` - Artist-studio relationship consistency
- `images` - Studio image accessibility and format
- `addresses` - Studio address and postcode validation
- `consistency` - Cross-service studio data consistency

**Examples:**
```bash
# Comprehensive validation
npm run validate-studios

# Validate relationships only
npm run validate-studios:relationships

# Validate studio images
npm run validate-studios:images

# Validate addresses and postcodes
npm run validate-studios:addresses
```

**Requirements Addressed:** 6.2, 6.4, 6.5

### 3. `reset-studios` - Studio Data Reset

Reset studio data while preserving artist data.

**Usage:**
```bash
npm run reset-studios [options]
node scripts/data-cli.js reset-studios [options]
```

**Options:**
- `--preserve-relationships` - Clear studio data but keep artist-studio references
- `--scenario <name>` - Reseed with specific scenario after reset
- `--validate` - Validate data consistency after reset

**Examples:**
```bash
# Basic studio reset
npm run reset-studios

# Reset and reseed with scenario
npm run reset-studios --scenario studio-diverse

# Reset while preserving relationships
npm run reset-studios:preserve --validate
```

**Requirements Addressed:** 6.3, 6.4, 6.5

### 4. `studio-status` - Studio Status Information

Display studio data counts and status information.

**Usage:**
```bash
npm run studio-status
node scripts/data-cli.js studio-status
```

**Information Provided:**
- Total studio count and active studios
- Studios with images and artist assignments
- Artist-studio relationship statistics
- Studio image accessibility status
- Data consistency across services

**Example:**
```bash
npm run studio-status
```

**Requirements Addressed:** 6.4, 6.5, 6.6

### 5. `process-studio-images` - Studio Image Processing

Process and upload studio images to S3.

**Usage:**
```bash
npm run process-studio-images [options]
node scripts/data-cli.js process-studio-images [options]
```

**Options:**
- `--studio-id <id>` - Process images for specific studio only
- `--force` - Reprocess existing images
- `--validate` - Validate image accessibility after processing

**Examples:**
```bash
# Process all studio images
npm run process-studio-images

# Process specific studio
npm run process-studio-images --studio-id studio-001

# Force reprocessing with validation
npm run process-studio-images:force --validate
```

**Requirements Addressed:** 6.6

### 6. `manage-studio-relationships` - Relationship Management

Manage artist-studio relationship assignments.

**Usage:**
```bash
npm run manage-studio-relationships [action]
node scripts/data-cli.js manage-studio-relationships [action]
```

**Actions:**
- `validate` - Validate all artist-studio relationships
- `rebuild` - Rebuild relationships based on location and style compatibility
- `repair` - Repair inconsistent or broken relationships
- `report` - Generate relationship status report

**Examples:**
```bash
# Validate relationships
npm run manage-studio-relationships:validate

# Rebuild all relationships
npm run manage-studio-relationships:rebuild

# Repair inconsistent relationships
npm run manage-studio-relationships:repair

# Generate relationship report
npm run manage-studio-relationships:report
```

**Requirements Addressed:** 6.5, 6.6

## Studio-Specific Scenarios

The following scenarios are optimized for studio testing:

### Studio-Focused Scenarios
- `studio-diverse` - Diverse studio types and specializations
- `london-studios` - London-focused studios with proper postcodes
- `high-rated-studios` - High-rated studios (4.5+ stars)

### Usage Examples
```bash
# Seed diverse studio types
npm run seed-studios --scenario studio-diverse

# Reset to London-focused studios
npm run reset-studios --scenario london-studios

# Validate high-rated studios
npm run seed-studios --scenario high-rated-studios --validate
```

## Integration with Existing Commands

Studio commands integrate seamlessly with existing data management commands:

### Combined Operations
```bash
# Full setup including studios
npm run setup-data

# Reset all data including studios
npm run reset-data fresh

# Validate all data including studios
npm run validate-data all
```

### Studio-Specific Workflows
```bash
# Studio development workflow
npm run seed-studios --scenario studio-diverse
npm run validate-studios relationships
npm run process-studio-images --validate
npm run studio-status

# Studio troubleshooting workflow
npm run validate-studios all
npm run manage-studio-relationships repair
npm run reset-studios --preserve-relationships
```

## Error Handling and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Studio Seeding Failures:**
```bash
# Check system health
npm run health-check

# Validate existing data
npm run validate-studios consistency

# Reset and retry
npm run reset-studios --scenario minimal
```

**Relationship Inconsistencies:**
```bash
# Validate relationships
npm run manage-studio-relationships validate

# Repair inconsistencies
npm run manage-studio-relationships repair

# Rebuild if necessary
npm run manage-studio-relationships rebuild
```

**Image Processing Issues:**
```bash
# Check image accessibility
npm run validate-studios images

# Reprocess images
npm run process-studio-images --force

# Validate after processing
npm run process-studio-images --validate
```

## Command Validation

All studio commands include comprehensive validation:

### Scenario Validation
- Validates scenario names against available scenarios
- Provides suggestions for invalid scenarios
- Lists available scenarios on error

### Parameter Validation
- Studio count must be positive numbers
- Studio IDs must follow format `studio-XXX`
- Validation types must be from allowed list
- Relationship actions must be valid

### Example Validation Errors
```bash
# Invalid scenario
npm run seed-studios --scenario invalid-name
# Error: Invalid scenario: invalid-name
# Available scenarios: minimal, studio-diverse, london-studios...

# Invalid validation type
npm run validate-studios invalid-type
# Error: Invalid studio validation type: invalid-type
# Available types: all, data, relationships, images, addresses, consistency
```

## Performance Considerations

### Large Studio Datasets
```bash
# Performance testing with many studios
npm run seed-studios --scenario performance-test --count 50

# Monitor performance
npm run studio-status

# Validate performance impact
npm run validate-studios consistency
```

### Incremental Operations
```bash
# Process specific studio only
npm run process-studio-images --studio-id studio-001

# Validate specific aspects
npm run validate-studios relationships

# Targeted relationship management
npm run manage-studio-relationships repair
```
