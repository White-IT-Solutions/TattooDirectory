```bash
npm run setup-data:frontend-only
```
- Generated 8 enhanced mock artists successfully
- Updated frontend mock data file correctly
- Completed in 2.9s with no errors
- All enhanced features working (bio, pricing, availability, experience)

**✅ Scenario Seeding Testing:**
```bash
npm run seed-scenario:minimal
```
- Seeded 2 artists and 1 studio successfully
- Generated 3 enhanced mock artists for frontend
- Updated frontend mock data with scenario-specific data
- Completed in 2.3s with no errors

**✅ Error Handling Testing:**
```bash
node -e "manager.seedScenario('invalid-scenario-name')"
```
- Invalid scenario properly detected and handled
- Graceful error handling confirmed (no exceptions thrown)
- Error messages properly logged and displayed
