# AWS Config Compliance Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the AWS Config implementation for the Tattoo Artist Directory project, providing comprehensive compliance monitoring and governance capabilities.

## Architecture

The AWS Config implementation includes:

1. **Configuration Recorder**: Tracks resource configurations and changes
2. **Delivery Channel**: Stores configuration snapshots in S3
3. **Config Rules**: Evaluates resource compliance against security and operational standards
4. **Conformance Packs**: Groups related rules for specific compliance frameworks
5. **Monitoring & Alerting**: Real-time notifications for compliance violations
6. **VPC Flow Logs**: Network traffic monitoring for security analysis

## Config Rules Implemented

### Security Rules

| Rule Name | Purpose | Criticality |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `s3-bucket-public-access-prohibited` | Ensures S3 buckets are not publicly accessible | HIGH |
| `s3-bucket-ssl-requests-only` | Enforces HTTPS-only access to S3 buckets | HIGH |
| `s3-bucket-server-side-encryption-enabled` | Verifies S3 bucket encryption | HIGH |
| `dynamodb-table-encryption-enabled` | Ensures DynamoDB tables are encrypted | HIGH |
| `dynamodb-pitr-enabled` | Verifies Point-in-Time Recovery is enabled | MEDIUM |
| `lambda-function-public-access-prohibited` | Prevents public Lambda function access | HIGH |
| `lambda-inside-vpc` | Ensures Lambda functions run in VPC | MEDIUM |
| `cloudfront-origin-access-identity-enabled` | Verifies CloudFront OAI configuration | MEDIUM |
| `cloudfront-viewer-policy-https` | Enforces HTTPS viewer policy | HIGH |

### Infrastructure Rules

| Rule Name | Purpose | Criticality |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `vpc-default-security-group-closed` | Ensures default security groups are restrictive | HIGH |
| `vpc-flow-logs-enabled` | Verifies VPC Flow Logs are enabled | MEDIUM |
| `api-gw-execution-logging-enabled` | Ensures API Gateway logging is enabled | MEDIUM |
| `kms-cmk-not-scheduled-for-deletion` | Prevents accidental KMS key deletion | HIGH |

### IAM Rules

| Rule Name | Purpose | Criticality |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `iam-policy-no-statements-with-admin-access` | Prevents overly permissive IAM policies | HIGH |
| `iam-user-no-policies-check` | Ensures IAM users don't have direct policies | MEDIUM |

## Environment-Specific Configuration

### Development Environment
- **Config Rules**: All rules enabled for testing
- **Retention**: 90 days for configuration history
- **Remediation**: Manual only
- **Alerting**: Basic email notifications

### Production Environment
- **Config Rules**: All rules enabled with strict enforcement
- **Conformance Packs**: Security and operational best practices
- **Retention**: 7 years for configuration history
- **Remediation**: Automatic for critical violations
- **Alerting**: Enhanced monitoring with Lambda processing

## Monitoring and Alerting

### CloudWatch Dashboards
- **Config Compliance Dashboard**: Real-time compliance status
- **Resource Compliance Trends**: Historical compliance data
- **Rule-specific Metrics**: Individual rule performance

### SNS Notifications
- **Email Alerts**: Immediate notifications for compliance violations
- **Critical Violations**: Enhanced alerting for high-severity issues
- **Compliance Changes**: Real-time updates on resource compliance status

### EventBridge Integration
- **Compliance Events**: Automated processing of compliance changes
- **Lambda Processing**: Custom logic for critical violation handling
- **Cross-service Integration**: Triggers for remediation workflows

## Cost Optimization

### Configuration Items
- **Selective Recording**: Focus on security-critical resources
- **Retention Policies**: Environment-appropriate data retention
- **Delivery Frequency**: Optimized snapshot delivery

### Rule Evaluation
- **Targeted Rules**: Only essential compliance checks
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient rule evaluation
- **Resource Filtering**: Scope rules to relevant resources

## Compliance Frameworks

### Security Best Practices
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Network security and access controls
- Identity and access management
- Logging and monitoring

### Operational Excellence
- Resource configuration management
- Change tracking and auditing
- Automated compliance monitoring
- Incident response capabilities

## Usage Instructions

### Viewing Compliance Status
```bash
# Check overall compliance
aws configservice get-compliance-summary-by-config-rule

# Check specific rule compliance
aws configservice get-compliance-details-by-config-rule \
  --config-rule-name tattoo-artist-directory-s3-bucket-public-access-prohibited
```

### Accessing Dashboards
- **Config Console**: AWS Config service console
- **CloudWatch Dashboards**: Custom compliance dashboards
- **S3 Configuration History**: Detailed configuration snapshots

### Remediation Process
1. **Automatic**: Critical violations trigger immediate remediation (prod only)
2. **Manual**: Review compliance violations and apply fixes
3. **Preventive**: Use Config rules to prevent non-compliant deployments

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Review compliance dashboard weekly
- Update Config rules as requirements change
- Monitor costs and optimize retention policies
- Test remediation procedures quarterly

### Rule Updates
- Add new rules for emerging security requirements
- Modify existing rules based on operational needs
- Remove deprecated or unnecessary rules

## Integration with CI/CD

### Pre-deployment Checks
- Validate Terraform configurations against Config rules
- Run compliance tests in development environment
- Block deployments that would create non-compliant resources

### Post-deployment Validation
- Automatic compliance evaluation after deployments
- Rollback procedures for compliance violations
- Continuous monitoring of resource configurations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Rule Evaluation Failures**: Check IAM permissions and resource availability
- **False Positives**: Review rule parameters and resource configurations
- **Missing Notifications**: Verify SNS topic subscriptions and permissions

### Debugging Steps
1. Check Config service status and permissions
2. Review CloudWatch logs for rule evaluation errors
3. Validate S3 bucket permissions for configuration delivery
4. Test SNS topic subscriptions and delivery

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- Configuration data encrypted with KMS
- S3 bucket access restricted to Config service
- CloudWatch logs encrypted and access-controlled

### Access Control
- Least-privilege IAM roles for Config service
- Separate roles for remediation actions
- Audit trail for all configuration changes

### Compliance Monitoring
- Real-time alerting for security violations
- Automated response to critical compliance issues
- Regular compliance reporting and review

## Cost Monitoring

### Config Costs
- Configuration items recorded: ~$0.003 per item
- Config rule evaluations: ~$0.001 per evaluation
- S3 storage for configuration history
- CloudWatch logs and metrics

### Optimization Strategies
- Selective resource recording
- Appropriate retention policies
- Efficient rule evaluation schedules
- Regular cost review and optimization
