# Production Parity Validation Suite

This directory contains a comprehensive suite of tools for validating production parity and deployment readiness for the Tattoo Artist Directory application.

## Overview

The production parity validation suite ensures that your local development environment accurately simulates production behavior and that your application is ready for production deployment. It consists of four main components:

1. **Production Parity Validator** - Validates AWS service simulation accuracy and configuration parity
2. **Deployment Simulation Tester** - Tests deployment scenarios and rollback capabilities
3. **Production Readiness Checklist** - Comprehensive checklist validation for production deployment
4. **Comprehensive Parity Validator** - Unified interface that runs all validation tools

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Local development environment running (LocalStack, backend, frontend)
- Node.js and npm installed

### Run All Validations

```bash
# Run comprehensive validation (recommended)
node scripts/validation/comprehensive-parity-validator.js validate

# Generate detailed report
node scripts/validation/comprehensive-parity-validator.js report > validation-report.json
```

### Individual Tool Usage

```bash
# Production parity validation
node scripts/validation/production-parity-validator.js validate

# Deployment simulation testing
node scripts/validation/deployment-simulation-tester.js simulate

# Production readiness checklist
node scripts/validation/production-readiness-checklist.js validate
```

## Tool Details

### 1. Production Parity Validator

Validates that your local environment matches production behavior.

**Features:**
- AWS service simulation accuracy (DynamoDB, OpenSearch, S3, API Gateway)
- Environment variable and configuration parity
- API behavior consistency verification
- Production readiness assessment

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run validation
node scripts/validation/production-parity-validator.js validate

# Generate report
node scripts/validation/production-parity-validator.js report
```

**Key Validations:**
- DynamoDB table structure and query behavior
- OpenSearch index structure and search functionality
- S3 bucket operations and error handling
- API Gateway routing and response handling
- Configuration consistency between local and production

### 2. Deployment Simulation Tester

Simulates production deployment scenarios to validate deployment readiness.

**Features:**
- Blue-green deployment simulation
- Rolling deployment simulation
- Rollback scenario testing
- Health check validation during deployment
- Service dependency validation

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run simulation
node scripts/validation/deployment-simulation-tester.js simulate

# Generate report
node scripts/validation/deployment-simulation-tester.js report
```

**Key Simulations:**
- Container deployment and startup
- Service orchestration and dependency management
- Traffic switching and load balancing
- Failure detection and automatic rollback
- Data consistency during deployments

### 3. Production Readiness Checklist

Comprehensive checklist validation for production deployment readiness.

**Features:**
- Pre-deployment checklist (code review, testing, security)
- Deployment checklist (infrastructure, SSL, DNS)
- Post-deployment checklist (health checks, monitoring)
- Operational readiness (incident response, team access)
- Security readiness (authentication, encryption)
- Performance readiness (response times, throughput)

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run checklist validation
node scripts/validation/production-readiness-checklist.js validate

# Generate report
node scripts/validation/production-readiness-checklist.js report

# Export checklist template
node scripts/validation/production-readiness-checklist.js template
```

**Checklist Categories:**
- **Pre-Deployment**: Code review, tests, security scan, documentation
- **Deployment**: Infrastructure, SSL certificates, DNS, backup systems
- **Post-Deployment**: Health checks, monitoring, log aggregation
- **Operational**: Incident response, team access, disaster recovery
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, data encryption
- **Performance**: Response times, throughput, caching, optimization

### 4. Comprehensive Parity Validator

Unified interface that runs all validation tools and provides consolidated results.

**Features:**
- Runs all validation tools in sequence
- Calculates weighted overall score
- Identifies critical blocking issues
- Generates prioritized recommendations
- Provides production readiness assessment

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run comprehensive validation
node scripts/validation/comprehensive-parity-validator.js validate

# Generate comprehensive report
node scripts/validation/comprehensive-parity-validator.js report

# Generate CI/CD integration script
node scripts/validation/comprehensive-parity-validator.js ci-script
```

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Integration

```yaml
name: Production Parity Validation

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  validate-production-parity:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18'
        
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
      
    - name: Start local environment
      run: |
        docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d
        sleep 30
        
    - name: Run production parity validation
      run: node scripts/validation/comprehensive-parity-validator.js validate
      
    - name: Generate validation report
      run: node scripts/validation/comprehensive-parity-validator.js report > validation-report.json
      
    - name: Upload validation report
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: validation-report
        path: validation-report.json
```

### Generated CI Script

The comprehensive validator can generate a CI/CD integration script:

```bash
node scripts/validation/comprehensive-parity-validator.js ci-script
```

This creates `scripts/ci-validation.sh` that can be used in any CI/CD system.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Required environment variables for validation:

```bash
# AWS Configuration
AWS_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:4566
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=eu-west-2
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=test
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=test

# Application Configuration
NODE_ENV=development
DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME=tattoo-directory-local
OPENSEARCH_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4566
```

### Validation Thresholds

You can customize validation thresholds by modifying the validator configuration:

```javascript
// Example: Custom thresholds
const customConfig = {
  responseTimeThreshold: 1000, // ms
  throughputThreshold: 5,      // requests/second
  availabilityThreshold: 95,   // percentage
  overallScoreThreshold: 80    // minimum passing score
};
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Services Not Running**
   ```bash
   # Check service status
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml ps
   
   # Restart services
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml restart
   ```

2. **LocalStack Connection Issues**
   ```bash
   # Check LocalStack health
   curl http://localhost:4566/_localstack/health
   
   # Check LocalStack logs
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml logs localstack
   ```

3. **Validation Timeouts**
   ```bash
   # Increase timeout values in validation scripts
   # Check network connectivity
   # Verify service endpoints are accessible
   ```

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging for detailed validation information:

```bash
DEBUG=1 node scripts/validation/comprehensive-parity-validator.js validate
```
