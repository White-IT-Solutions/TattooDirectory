# Task 4 Build Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Syntax Errors
- **Fixed broken import line**: Removed stray "c" character that was breaking the `const` declaration
- **Fixed import paths**: Corrected relative paths for feedback components

### 2. Import/Export Issues
- **Button Component**: Changed from named import `{ Button }` to default import `Button`
- **SearchValidation Component**: Created missing `SearchValidation` component export
- **cva Utility**: Fixed import path from `../../../utils/cva` to `../../../utils/cn`

### 3. Duplicate Function Declarations
- **handleSuggestionSelect**: Removed duplicate function declaration, kept the more complete version

## Build Status

✅ **Enhanced Search Components**: All components now compile successfully
✅ **Import Resolution**: All import paths resolved correctly
✅ **Type Safety**: No TypeScript errors in search components
⚠️ **Prerendering Error**: Unrelated issue with data-visualization-demo page

## Components Successfully Integrated

1. **EnhancedSmartSearch**: Main enhanced search component with all features
2. **SearchProgressIndicator**: Progress feedback during search operations
3. **SearchErrorMessage**: Error handling with recovery suggestions
4. **SearchValidation**: Input validation with real-time feedback
5. **SmartSearchWrapper**: Dynamic loading wrapper for SSR compatibility

## Features Working

- ✅ Contextual help with search tips
