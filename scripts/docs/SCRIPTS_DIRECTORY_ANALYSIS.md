- `scripts/data-management/setup-test-data.js` - **ARCHIVED** (moved to backups/archive)
- `scripts/data-management/update-test-data.js` - **ARCHIVED** (moved to backups/archive)
- `scripts/data-management/seed-data.js` - **NOT FOUND** (likely already removed)

#### Legacy Data Seeder Scripts (Deprecated but Present)
- `scripts/data-seeder/seed.js` - **LEGACY** - Marked as deprecated, redirects to seed-wrapper.js
- `scripts/data-seeder/selective-seeder.js` - **LEGACY** - Marked as deprecated, redirects to selective-seeder-wrapper.js
- `scripts/data-seeder/seed-legacy.sh` - **LEGACY** - Wrapper for backward compatibility
- `scripts/data-seeder/seed-legacy.bat` - **LEGACY** - Wrapper for backward compatibility

### Package.json Legacy References

The `scripts/package.json` still contains some legacy npm script references:
```json
"setup": "node data-management/setup-test-data.js",  // BROKEN - file archived
"update-data": "node data-management/update-test-data.js",  // BROKEN - file archived
```

These should be updated to use the new unified system commands.

## Migration Status Summary

### Completed ‚úÖ
- Shell script wrappers: Already removed/archived
- Legacy data-management scripts: Already archived
- Unified system: Fully implemented and functional
- Backward compatibility: Maintained through wrapper system

### In Progress ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Legacy data-seeder scripts: Present but marked deprecated with compatibility wrappers
- Package.json: Contains broken references to archived files

### Review Needed üîç
1. **`scripts/state-tracker.js`** - May be superseded by `state-manager.js`
2. **`scripts/seed-opensearch.mjs`** - May be redundant with unified system
3. **Legacy npm scripts in package.json** - Need updating to remove broken references
4. **Duplicate files** - Some monitoring files may be duplicated between root and monitoring directory

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Update package.json** - Remove broken references to archived files
2. **Review state-tracker.js** - Determine if still needed or can be removed
3. **Review seed-opensearch.mjs** - Determine if functionality is covered by unified system
4. **Clean up duplicates** - Review and remove duplicate monitoring files if present

### Future Considerations
1. **Archive legacy wrappers** - Once Docker integration is fully migrated, archive legacy wrapper scripts
2. **Consolidate monitoring** - Review monitoring directory for potential consolidation
3. **Documentation updates** - Ensure all documentation reflects current system structure
4. **Test coverage** - Ensure comprehensive test coverage for all current files

The scripts directory represents a well-architected, comprehensive development environment with enterprise-grade capabilities for monitoring, security, performance, and production readiness validation. The migration to the unified system is largely complete and successful.
