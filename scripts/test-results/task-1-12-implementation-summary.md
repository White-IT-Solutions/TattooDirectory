### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Docker Container Testing
```javascript
// Container health check with timeout
await this.waitForContainerHealth('tattoo-directory-localstack', 60000);

// Volume mount validation
const testFile = path.join(this.projectRoot, 'scripts', 'test-volume-mount.txt');
const testContent = `Volume mount test - ${new Date().toISOString()}`;
fs.writeFileSync(testFile, testContent);
```

#### 2. Cross-Platform Path Handling
```javascript
// Platform-aware path operations
const normalized = PathUtils.normalize(testPath);
const unixPath = PathUtils.toUnixPath(testPath);
const windowsPath = PathUtils.toWindowsPath(testPath);
const joined = PathUtils.join('scripts', 'test-data', 'artists.json');
```

#### 3. CLI Compatibility Testing
```javascript
// Test enhanced CLI options across platforms
const cliTests = [
  { name: 'Help option', command: 'node scripts/frontend-sync-processor.js --help' },
  { name: 'Scenario option', command: 'node scripts/frontend-sync-processor.js --scenario=single --dry-run' },
  { name: 'Export option', command: 'node scripts/frontend-sync-processor.js --scenario=few --export --dry-run' }
];
```

#### 4. Docker Network Validation
```javascript
// Test container-to-container networking
const networkTest = `docker exec tattoo-directory-localstack curl -f http://localstack:4566/_localstack/health`;
const result = CommandUtils.executeCommandSync(networkTest);
```

### Issues Identified and Fixed

#### 1. Container Health Check Timeout ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: LocalStack container health check timeout on Windows  
**Cause**: Health check command format not compatible with Windows Docker output  
**Solution**: Improved health check logic to use `docker ps` status parsing and endpoint testing  
**Fix Details**:
- Enhanced health check to parse actual container status from `docker ps`
- Added LocalStack endpoint testing as fallback health verification
- Implemented proper timeout handling with informative status updates

#### 2. Docker Network Configuration ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Custom Docker network not found during container testing  
**Cause**: Network name mismatch between expected and actual Docker Compose network names  
**Solution**: Dynamic network detection and fallback to host networking  
**Fix Details**:
- Added automatic Docker network discovery using `docker network ls`
- Implemented fallback to host network when custom network unavailable
- Enhanced error handling for network connectivity issues

#### 3. CLI Option Parsing ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: CLI compatibility tests failed due to missing argument parsing  
**Cause**: Frontend-sync-processor missing `--help`, `--dry-run`, and `--validate` options  
**Solution**: Enhanced CLI interface with comprehensive option support  
**Fix Details**:
- Added `--help` option with comprehensive usage documentation
- Implemented `--dry-run` mode for safe testing without execution
- Enhanced `--validate` option with proper data validation testing
- Improved argument parsing with better error handling and Windows compatibility
